    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p name="aboutme" id="aboutme">
        I am currently a third-year student at the University of Pretoria. I am studying towards an engineering degree
        (B. Eng
        Computer Engineering).
        I have not worked full-time, so this CV will focus on personal and academic achievements so far.<br>
        I am a well-balanced individual with versatile interests. I have travelled abroad as part of an exchange program which has benefited me greatly as an individual.<br>

        I love acting and have participated on stage throughout my schooling career â€“ this has made me a natural and confident public speaker. Attending a good stage performance or movie is an enjoyable experience for me. I like running or a bit of mountain-biking, as well as a social squash game.<br>
        
        Of all my passions, technology remains my one true love.
    </p>
    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In 2023 I was one among a team of tutors for the COS110 (Program design: Introduction | C++) module at the University of Pretoria. Our duties included helping students with programming assignments, as well as answering questions and discussing programming exercises with students in a lecture hall.</li>
        <li>In 2023 I also attended a week long vacation work at BBD Software in Johannesburg. With the help of other aspiring developers, we created an interactive web-based quiz game with a twist. My group was responsible for creating a quiz engine for the game.</li>
        <li>In 2024 I was among a team of tutors for the ERS220 (Digital Systems) module at the University of Pretoria. Our duties included grading scientific reports and assessing circuit functionality.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Coding Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In 2022 I developed a mobile game that emulates the popular drinking game, Kings. Since then the app has accumulated more than 5000 users, and produced much more smiles. The app was built using dart and the flutter library.</li>
        <li>In 2024, as part of a university project, I worked in a group that created an AI-based textbook grading web-app. Using the tensorflow model, we developed a system that could accurately recognize the condition of a textbook from a couple of images. This system was developed using python, angular, and a touch of C#.</li>
        <li>A scientific calculator that, honestly, is worse than an abacus.</li>
    </ul>
